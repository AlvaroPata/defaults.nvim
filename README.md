### Introduction

A small, featureful, and documented starting point for neovim. This config will always be:

* Small
* Single-file
* Documented

### Contribution

Pull-requests are welcome, but keep in mind that the goal of this repo is not to create a neovim configuration framework, but instead to offer a starting template which gives a decent experience out of the box. Each PR, especially those which increase the line count, should have a description as to why the PR is necessary.
